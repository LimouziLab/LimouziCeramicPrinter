base on the project of unfold.be and other source on the web, 
we decide to make a ceramic printer by our own.

1/ Unfold.be

first of all, we found this project, an interesting one, but not the only one. 
we have jump to the most interessant part of the project, the website which explain how to do it by ourself. 
we have read everything, and have found that the parts were the ceramic is extruded by air pressure was not perfect for us.

then, we found the jonathan keep project, which is another application of the unfold project.

another good informations for our project.

2/ update the design
